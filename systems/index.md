# House Rules
## Abstracted living and travel

### Base Locations

- The home village or town a PC is from is their first **Base Location**
- PCs can establish other **Base Locations** based on the narrative.
- The cost of living in a **Base Location** is waived, as the PCs take up small jobs.
- PCs can start incursions from **Base Locations** but travel between them costs 5gp in supplies per journey day. Returning from the incursion to a **Base Location** is abstracted and waived.

### Safe Locations

- Crossroad inns and non-hostile settlements PCs have visited before are **Safe Locations**.
- PCs can start incursion from **Safe Locations**, but travel costs 5gp in supplies per journey day.
- Boarding in a **Safe Location** (so PCs start adventuring the next morning after travel) is possible and costs 10gp.
