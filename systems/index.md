# Cairn 2e

- ***unsettled*** uses **Cairn 2e** as the base rules.
- **Cairn 2e**'s <a href="https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/" target="_blank">website version</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8mFMxYSdlwrsfwhT0CNalPoW9gdl5uE/view?usp=drivesdk" target="_blank">PDF version</a> are available for free.
- Extensions to the base rules, when needed, will be published on this website.

# Downtime

- Cost of living when in a city the PCs have a house and a job is waived.
- Crossroad inns and non-hostile settlements PCs have visited before can be used for starting an adventure, but if PCs do not have a house and a job there, they will have to pay the daily rates for boarding (10 gp).
- Travelling between these locations during downtime incurs no risk, but costs 5 gp in supplies per day.

# Character Generation

- You can roll your character manually using the Cairn book or website.
- Alternatively, use Kettlewright or Perchance below.
- You may adapt your *Description* and *Bonds* sections as you see fit.
- Paste a copy of your character and introduce them on the [Dramatis Personae](https://discord.com/channels/1060840338777964565/1340382334674927647) channel.
