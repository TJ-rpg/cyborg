"Villagers of Sigisfarne, today we gather to bid farewell to **Hilda**, our peculiar and beloved friend. At just 18, she brought the spirit of the forest to life, living not by convention but by her own mushroom-fueled whimsy. 

Hilda adored the woods—barefoot and laughing among the toadstools, she whispered secrets to the fungi and found joy where few dared to look. Her strange passion for mushrooms wasn't just a hobby; it was her soul. Whether she cooked them, studied them, or possibly dreamed in spores, they were her world.

She was unapologetically herself—a bold presence who turned every village festival into her own peculiar celebration. And while her ways sometimes baffled Sigisfarne, she made us smile, she made us wonder, and she made life a little more magical.

Now, as we lay her to rest near the glade where the mushrooms grow in golden rings, we know she'll forever be part of the forest she loved. Farewell, Hilda, may the great beyond welcome you with endless fields of fungi." 

*Hilda, the Mushroom Maiden of Sigisfarne, you will not be forgotten.*
