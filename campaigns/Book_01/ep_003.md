## Bittersweet Berries

As the sun hung between promise and threat, [Drake](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Yewtree](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Yewtree.md), [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Mateus](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md) and [Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) followed the river's thread down the southern slopes. 

In a place where river had claimed earth—neither truly land nor water—they discovered a bush crowned with berries that gleamed brightly in the fading light. The perfume bewitched their senses. They gathered far beyond what hunger demanded.

They failed to mark the passage of time until the sky's mood shifted. The rain that fell was neither ice nor water, but something in-between that bit at exposed skin and transformed the path into treacherous ground that seemed to reach for their ankles with each step.

## The Cave

The entrance yawned before them. They navigated the twisting passages as described in the tales of Clive's friends.

Where the cavern opened to reveal a pool of still water, they encountered creatures with eyes like dying embers. The [reptiloids](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Reptiloids.md) watched, communicating in sounds that resembled language yet guttural and ***unsettling***. No hostility passed between them, only a wary recognition.

Trees stood petrified in front of the temple doors, wood once bound in iron but now petrified.

Further within, where the cave's breath grew colder, they discovered a grotesque collection—limbs of beast and man. Some were fresh enough that flies still found interest, others had long since surrendered their substance to time.

## The Abandoned Temple

Inside, statues loomed larger than any mortal ought to be, draped in noble garments of a fashion that had never graced the courts of any known kingdom. Where faces should have offered identity, only scrapped blankness remained, as though their very features had been devoured.

Columns rose like ancient trees, supporting a ceiling that vanished into shadows despite the height suggested by the elegant fan vaulting. The air carried the scent of dust. The architecture reminded them of the ruined church, in [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md), and of the [Weeping Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md).

A descent revealed further mysteries. A section of floor harboured deception beneath the gaze of a grotesque figure rendered in stone. The statue depicted a being of impossible corpulence.

Below, a cathedral that had never known sunlight spread before them. Its floor wore a carpet of stone fragments that crunched beneath their boots. From cracks in the walls sprouted mushrooms tall as children. Among the debris, they discovered a music box of curious design.

Other passages beckoned from the darkness, promising further secrets. But weariness had settled into their bones, and something in the air—a subtle wrongness that defied description—suggested that Sigisfarne's familiar comforts would be the wiser choice. For now.
