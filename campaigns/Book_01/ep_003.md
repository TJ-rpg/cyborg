## Bittersweet Berries

As the sun hung between promise and threat, [Drake](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Yewtree](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Yewtree.md), [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Mateus](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md) and [Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) followed the river's thread down the southern slopes. 

In a place where the river had claimed earth—neither truly land nor water—they discovered a bush crowned with berries that gleamed brightly in the fading light. The perfume bewitched their senses. They gathered far beyond what hunger demanded.

They failed to mark the passage of time until the sky's mood shifted. The rain that fell was neither ice nor water, but something in-between that bit at exposed skin and transformed the path into treacherous ground that seemed to reach for their ankles with each step.

#### Cai:

*We are going downhill - blood in the grass is washing out. We see bodies of animals. One has yellow skin, and the other is a bigger animal with a dark brown colour. Pumas and bisons. Mateus kills the almost dead ones out of respect.*

#### Mateus:

*Why are these animals killing each other?*

## The Cave

The entrance yawned before them. They navigated the twisting passages as described in the tales of Clive's friends.

Where the cavern opened to reveal a pool of still water, they encountered creatures with eyes like dying embers. The [reptiloids](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Reptiloids.md) watched, communicating in sounds that resembled language yet guttural and ***unsettling***. No hostility passed between them, only a wary recognition.

#### Cai:

*After walking a while downwards there is a flooded area Knees deep waters, but it’s quite long. There is something in the water - we hear a splash. Matheus threw bait and I aimed towards it. A small alligator with red eyes and a tilted mouth, coming slowly towards the lure. Another one is coming as well. It looks like they are looking at us. Third eye is coming out of the water - they are not really crooked. 3-eyes crocodiles that talk in some weird language.*

Three trees stood petrified in front of the three temple doors, wood once bound in iron but now petrified. They have carvings that remind of the church weeping mother.

**Three eyes, three trees, three doors.**

Further within, where the cave's breath grew colder, they discovered a grotesque collection—limbs of beast and man. They were pulled, not severed. Some were fresh enough that flies still found interest, others had long since surrendered their substance to time.

#### Cai:

*Hissing sound of wind coming from the top - after taking the piece of bioluminescence stone. The torches are out.*

## The Abandoned Temple

Inside, statues loomed larger than any mortal ought to be, draped in noble garments of a fashion that had never graced the courts of any known kingdom. Where faces should have offered identity, only scrapped blankness remained, as though their very features had been devoured.

Columns rose like ancient trees, supporting a ceiling that vanished into shadows despite the height suggested by the elegant fan vaulting. The air carried the scent of dust. Floor is black and white tiles. Make patterns like in other secret places. The architecture reminded them of the ruined church, in [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md), and of the [Weeping Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md). The statues are not of the symbology of the church.

A descent revealed further mysteries. A section of floor harboured deception beneath the gaze of a grotesque figure rendered in stone. The statue depicted a being of impossible corpulence.

#### Cai:

*Statue hanging on the ceiling - different from the other statues. Clothes are caricaturish of normal clothes - face is also a caricature - fat, double chinned, fat arms and belly. Serpents coiled around it - held by chains.
“we don’t need to find all the answers, just the right ones, let’s move ahead.“
Mateus steps on the triangle and the floor falls, thankfully while hanging from the statue. 
Cai gets startled and breaks her knife.
The floor below has the same patterns as the one above it. Furniture that resembles the ruined church desks, long benches.*

Below, a cathedral that had never known sunlight spread before them. Its floor wore a carpet of stone fragments that crunched beneath their boots. From cracks in the walls sprouted mushrooms tall as children. Among the debris, they discovered a music box of curious design.

Other passages beckoned from the darkness, promising further secrets. But weariness had settled into their bones, and something in the air—a subtle wrongness that defied description—suggested that Sigisfarne's familiar comforts would be the wiser choice. For now.

1 hour from the cave it is freezing cold.   
20 minutes far: we are going downhill \- there is blood in the grass that’s washing out. You see bodies of animals. One with yellow skin and a bigger animal with dark brown color. Pumas and bisons.  
Matheus kills the almost dead ones.   
4 moving in pain pumas, and 3 bisons already dead. 

**In the cave:**   
After walking a while downwards there is a flooded area.  
Knees deep waters, but it’s quite long.   
There is something in the water \- we hear a splash.  
Matheus threw bait and Cai aimed towards it. A small alligator with red eyes and a tilted mouth, coming slowly towards the lure.   
Another one is coming as well. It looks like they are looking at us.   
Third eye is coming out of the water \- they are not really crooked.   
3-eyes crocodiles that talk in some weird language.

3 doors with wood and iron-bounding. \- petrified wood as well. They have carvings that remind of the church weeping mother.  
3 trees (2 meters tall \+ bit of a root), laying on the floor. They seem to be made of stone.  
Petrified. The middle was wooden. Something like covered in stone.

Limbs of animals and people decomposing where Matheus went. They were pulled, not severed.   
Hissing sound of wind coming from the top \- after taking the piece of bioluminescence stone. The torches are out.

Behind the doors:

- Statues 2.5 m tall \- resemble carvings seen before \- their faces have been scraped.  
- Floor is black and white tiles. Make patterns like in other secret places.  
- The statues are not necessarily of the symbology of the church.

Faces scrapped with a tool. Some holding staff or other objects.   
Place is super dusty \- closed off for a long time. These statues though, feel like they are looking at me. We feel tired.

Down the stairs there are debris on the left, but not on the right. Pieces of stone.   
Massive triangular recessed on the floor. 

Statue hanging on the ceiling \- different from the other statues. Clothes are caricaturish of normal clothes \- face is also a caricature \- fat, double chinned, fat arms and belly. Serpents coiled around it \- held by chains.

Cai says “ we don’t need to find all the answers, just the right ones, let’s move ahead. “ and tries to open the next door.   
Mateus steps on the triangle and the floor falls, thankfully while hanging from the statue.   
Cai gets startled and breaks her knife.  
The floor below has the same patterns as the one above it. Furniture that resembles the ruined church desks, long benches.
