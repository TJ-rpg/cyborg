## The fields

#### Hilda:

*The fields of [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) were dying. The farmer spoke of the ground that swallowed. He heard skittering sounds flee from him as he retreated. Four of us answered—[Mateus](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md), [Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) with her arrows, [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) with her half-magic, and [I](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md). We walked westward under warm, cloudy weather.*

#### Cai:

*Fields are barley, wheat. They are divided by very short stone walls, simple structure, not meant to stop people, just divide the land.*

*Matheus wandered off and claimed to see a masked face—bandits in the [Fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md), he said.*

## A pit in a farm

#### Hilda:

*The sinkhole waited for us like an open mouth, eight feet deep. I tried to embrace the descent, to slide gently into its throat, but the earth betrayed me.*

#### Cai:

*I screamed. I'm not ashamed to admit it. The fall was longer than it should have been. Matheus dropped his wolfsbane, and Razzy... Razzy floated down like she was half-made of air. The tunnels below smelled of sweetness and rot together.The tunnels were smooth as if shaped by animals. We chose sweetness—always a mistake in tales such as this.*

#### Hilda:

*They found us, [humanoids](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PitRodents.md) that should not be. Beetle-stags with glowing bellies, and the mole-men with their beetle armour and pincer spears. "Everything here is ours," they said. "I wouldn't advise taking arms against us! I suggest you do exactly as I say if you want to leave here alive!".*

#### Cai:

*They were fast—too fast. They surrounded us before we knew what was happening. Matheus tried to flee, but caught a spear in his shoulder. One of those beetle-things exploded in Hilda's face—its insides burning like forge-fire.*

#### Hilda:

*We fought like cornered foxes. Razzy... sweet Razzy changed. I had never seen such violence from her before. Her blade found the mole-man's neck, and she didn't stop until there was more blood than flesh. The red took her.*

#### Cai:

*"Alarm! Alarm!" they called in their tongue. More came from the darkness. Matheus shouted for us to run, dropping his torch—foolish in the darkness, but fear makes fools of us all. I shot one through the shoulder. Hilda—mad Hilda—grabbed one of the unconscious creatures and carried it with her. "What are you doing?" I shouted, but there's rarely sense in asking the senseless.*

## Why?

#### Hilda:

*The prisoner was our key to understanding. Razzy was our salvation—her spell brought forth a thicket from barren stone, tangling our pursuers in roots and vines. Their screams followed us up into daylight—screams not of pain, but of something being taken that was rightfully theirs.*

*We brought our prisoner to Sigisfarne's council. The old men crossed themselves and spoke of omens. The creature spoke of balance disrupted, of forests fallen to make way for our wheat, of ancient foundations beneath our homes.*

#### Cai:

*Matheus has a letter addressed to the Lord of the Winter. He asks them if they know him. They say yes, he is at his castle, North.* 

*When the rodent wakes up, he is terrified and feels helpless. We tell him that the crops are dying and that’s why we went there. The creature says that this is because you have taken too much land past what you need and what you justified taking. We are doing what we must to bring balance. We were trying to discourage you from expanding. We are exporters, and we expanded indeed in the forest, so this makes sense to us, it’s justified.*

*We asked whether they were there way before us.* 
*Their fathers knew the people that built the magnificent buildings, upon the ruins of what we built - like the church.* 
*When the dark moon comes, the vendetta will begin and all you can do is pray. He clearly indicates that they want to ruin our homes. But Matheus realises that there might be something we could do about it.*
