Hilda - fungal forager
Razzy - half witch 
Yarrow - greenwise
Kalamos - scrivener 

Hex crawl to Hendenburgh to the East of Sigisfarne to try find Hildas lost family 

Camped on a forested hill, we hear voices approached with caution, Hilda crept up and saw 3 creatures one is 8dt tall muscular (ogre?) and bloody arms, two have a animal heads (hare and boar) fighting the big guy they are nimble and he's not, they kill him despite his giant size.

Razzy hails them as they walk away SE - noticed they're athletic scarred, piercings and coloured skin, she pointed to her cravat and they aren't of the other Fae clan. She asked if they have seen Hilda's family they haven't seen them and are from the North they ask us "Do you burn?"

Yarrow replied "we do not burn forest"

They tell us their forest was burned and they have travelled around a wall to get here to avenge the burning. Kalamos writes their story.

Yarrow takes the ogres teeth, it's covered in lichen cuts off some to regrow and Kalamos sketches whilst Hilda checks out the area.

We camp the night and on her watch Yarrow noticed movement and spears it and flicks it away. In the morning Yarrow shows us the leech.

We continue East, keeping to grassland bit we are approached by creatures on 8 legs and human torsos, they surround us and ask us "Have you seen the Construct"
They advised us to stay away from it, it's a straw effigy with furnace as a heart and to tell them if we see it, they will allow to take haven with them as a reward. Yarrow sketches them. 
Hilda asks if they saw his family pass by 5 months ago.

We head SE then East then make it to Hedenburgh, deprived but made it safe.
