**The 1st of March**

A group consisting of Drake, Razvan, Hilda and Stone of Sigisfarne left the village in search of the Quarry.

They heard whistling on the way which was caused by the shapes a stream had carved into the rock over the years it has been flowing.
They arrived at the so-called Rabbit Inn at dusk and boarded there for the night.

They set off to the northeast again, hugging the border of the forest and passing by the swampland.

A growth of Aveva made their eyes itchy and diverted them northwest for some time before they could get back on track.

In the evening, a pair of pumas followed them from afar but kept their distance.

They camped in the open plains that night and were disturbed by a tall skeletal figure approaching, which the pumas, still in the vicinity, did not take kindly to. Warned by the felineâ€™s growling and hissing, they packed camp quickly and set off once again, away from the strange creature and travelling at night.

They reached a part of the forest where the trees are dead and found a cabin filled with game meat drying on racks. They stocked up and caught up on sleep before setting off and finding the Quarry.

Entering the Quarry, they discovered veins of red mineral running along the walls and followed them to find a sheer drop they almost missed. They followed the steps leading down the ravine to discover a tunnel, inside which they could hear hammering and chiselling.

They decided to turn back at that point and return at a later time, leaving the rope and grappling hook there.
