**The 30th of March**

A group consisting of Drake, Hilde, Yarrow and Stone set off from Sigisfarne towards the Underground Temple. On the way, a squad of Piot Chants ambush them with a giant swarm of ants and chased Hilda into the river. They are not hostile to the rest. They play music and watch Hilde struggle and chat with the others, making friends with Stone and paying Drake respects, recognising him as the one who beat the Faerie Knight in the race.

Ultimately, three of them take off their beetle shell armour and take to the water, reaching Hilde and killing her.

The others speak to the molemen who calls themselves Piot Chants, and offer to further their mutual relations. The creatures seem open to casual discussion if the PCs were to visit them, but remind them that there is one more they hunt still.

They enter the cave and see brambles growing out of the earth, very much like Razzy’s magic.

They encounter Indigo, a fellow Sigisfarne local, who makes his bread tricking passers-by and conning honest people out of their coin.

They went inside and through the hall of statues and the false floor trap, down to the church and as they explored the interior they encountered strange centaur/insect hybrid creatures copulating who were not hostile but spoke some of the party’s language, though not well.

They tried to establish what this place was and if the creatures had seen more people like them, and were led by one of them through a corridor, to a room with a stone floor and small human hands also made of stone, poking through the floor. As they kept being led through the corridor, the creature brought them to a small room with an oubliette, with a few mummified corpses and a fine sword with a black blade and a skull on the hilt as well as 3 silver and a gambeson, and a crumbling note on parchment with only three things legible - “Big Market”, “Wall, and “Village”.

Stone went back to Sigisfarne, thinking better of continuing to crawl the depths of this place, taking the silver, gambeson and sword with him, to be divvied later among the party when they return. The rest continued onwards.
