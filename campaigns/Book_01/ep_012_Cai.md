Drake, Razzy, Arlo, Cai

Dry but cold \- misty. 

During Cai’s watch, she hears the river. It’s very rainy. In the morning, it’s still raining.   
We reach a bridge, where the river splashes on. We see ruins, similar to those in Sigisfarne. We walk around the Ruins. Seems like continuation of Sigisfarne, but more destroyed. Parts look looted and there’s signs of a small civilization ¼ of the size of our village. Some goats around. We get one for food later.
