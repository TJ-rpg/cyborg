**The 22nd of March**

A group consisting of Drake, Cai, Matheus and Razvan left Sigisfarne to head southwest to look for the fae monarch in order to seek help with the molemen vendetta.

They encountered a young shepherd with goats called Yik, crying in the woods. He says he lost 3 of his 8 goats.

They find a fox caught in a trap. Matheus frees it and it stays with the group and leads them to the lost goats.

They return to Yik to deliver them and Yik thanks them and gives Drake an apple that instils him with confidence and energy and he tells them to head south and follow the singing if they want to find the faeries.

On the faerie trail, the strange and beautiful environment causes changes to the group and their senses. Cai’s hair turns pink and flowers grow from it and Razvan becomes smitten with Drake.

They find a faerie banquet. The faeries there seem to have been waiting for them and have been aware of them walking their trail that Yik pointed out. They spend some time there, partaking in the food, all except Cai who seems suspicious of it. They share stories from their everyday lives in the village and of their travels and delight the faeries.

One of the faeries, a child, offers food to Cai who refuses, making the child angry. Its mother intervenes and Cai, with her help, explains she doesn’t want the food but doesn’t dislike the child, which seems to calm it down. The child then asks to live with Cai and be taken back to the village, which Cai reluctantly agrees to, but then asks the group’s opinion. Matheus and Drake voice their concern about the idea and the mother leaves with the child in tow, clearly angry. Another faerie gets in a conversation with Razvan, who compliments her jewellery, in particular the cravat the faerie is wearing. The faerie gladly offers the cravat to the half-witch, who accepts.

The group leaves the banquet in time and notices another faerie following them with a large escort of goblins. The faerie knight approaches them and when Drake asks him what he wants, he says he wants to play a game which turns out to be a race to the castle of the Queen. Drake counter-offers that the race be a sort of tourney duel between him and the knight only, goblins and the rest of Drakes companions not to intervene. Terms are set: If Drake wins, the knight escorts them all out of the woods safely when their task is done. If the knight wins, he embraces Drake. The mercenary outrider asks the faerie knight to point out the direction of the castle, in case he stops hearing the song, to keep the race fair. The knight does so, anxious to start the race.

Drake hands his horse Dandy to Razvan and nervously tells his group he’ll meet them at the castle. The race begins. Drake manages to keep up, just barely, and reaches the castle just ahead of the knight, who pays his respects. The two become fast friends and the rest of Drake’s group meets them outside the castle, unharmed by the goblins who are nowhere to be seen.

The audience with the Queen begins and the group explains their predicament. Offers are made. the vendetta will be lifted for each person individually, with a different price for each: Razvan’s one-time service, to be called upon at a later time and Cai’s voice for a time. Matheus shows no interest in an offer to lift the vendetta. The Queen asks for the group to take her offer to Hilde, another victim of the vendetta, on a piece of parchment written in gold. Drake accepts the task.

They return to Sigisfarne with the faerie knight’s escort.
