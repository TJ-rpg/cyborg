**Razzy:** humble, used to be cowardly, she is filthy \- half witch. Forages medicinal herbs and making potions. She’s been on a couple of adventures. 44  
**Hilda:** 18 years old \- her parents disappeared under sus circumstances. She is convinced her brother is alive though, and wears a necklace with him. She loves mushrooms. She loves the dark. She is aggressive towards people.   
**Matheus:** No memory \- beast hunter. 

Sinkhole opened up in the fields. Looks like caverns with “things” roaming in the dark.  
Weather is cloudy but warm in the morning. We set off. Start moving west and explore the fields.   
Fields are barley, wheat.. They are divided by very short stone walls, simple structure, not meant to stop people, just divide the land. The fields open up in front of us, we can see from above. You think that you see some movement\!   
*Sigisfarne has been very unlucky in recent years. Attacked by bandits, travelers to and from there. Rising tensions and mistrust,, daily life getting more difficult and the community got split in factions, blaming each other.*   
We saw a bandit. We went away from him.   
Arrive at destination in the afternoon.   
**Weather update:** Wind picks up. There is pollen in the forest on the W-SW.   
In the middle of a field we see a sinkhole, fallen ground 8-10 feet (2-3 meters). Looks like a cave. 

We all went down, but only Razzy made it gracefully. Hilda and Matheus lost an item each and Cai just screamed in the dark, but nothing happened.

It’s claustrophobic here. The tallest has to crouch a little. At times we have to squeeze through. The walls are smooth earth, a bit humid, and soft. The kind of earth you expect under farmland. 

There is a sweet smell in the cavern on the right, and a commotion on the left. We follow our noses. Further down the caves, we hear a noise coming from the left, we stay to investigate, when we hear scuttling, like many legs/steps. There’s no footsteps on the ground, but the floor is heavily used. There are no precise digging marks that dug the tunnel, looks like an animal made it. Where the sound comes from, we see 2 shapes approach us very quickly (with eyes). 

Mattheus backtracks and tried to go where we came from. 3 (bigger than dog) humanoids are blocking the way. Look like rodents, their mouths. They are dressed peculiarly, they wear armor that looks like its made of beetle shells and they are armed with spears at the end of which are big scorpion pincers. They’ve been tied around these sticks.

The other 2 look like beetles and have antlers on their head and their abdomen glows orange. 

The rodents say “do exactly as you are told, don’t fight us”.  
Cai says “what the fuck are you?\!?”  
We give the orders and you follow them. You can consider yourselves lucky.. 

They open up their way and tell us to proceed North. More are coming from the South. They don’t say anything. Cai realises they are way out of their element and they should follow those weird creatures. But Matheus is too scared and tried to throw his net on one, which backfires. He is attacked by the 3 humanoids. Hilda is attacked from the back from the 2 creatures \- one explodes and one charges him. He gets very injured, but eventually kills it. Matheus throws his net on one of them and escapes. Cai passes the torch to Razzy and draws her bow, but misses. She tries to “save it” by saying “Stay back or next time I’ll get you\!”. Razzy got braver, took her iron dagger out and stabbed one at the top of his helmet, and went berserk on him, killing him\! 

Several yell “Alarm\! Alarm\!” in a different language.   
The ones in the back attack Hilda, but she survives despite all odds\! Cai is charged by one, but her armor protects her. 

Razzy is running back to stab the guy that’s attacking Cai. With a super violent hit, it’s messy as hell. She grabbed the back of his head, by the antler of the helmet, and twists it so that the back of the neck, is exposed. The sides of her vision blur, full of adrenaline. She plunged the dagger repeatedly, and violently ripped his flesh out, blood spilling everywhere. It is horrific\! She is then ganged up by the 3 rodents. She is hit and is *deprived*.    
More rodents come and Mateus leaves his torch on the ground and says “run you fools” and goes back. Everybody follows and Razzy drops her dagger and casts a *spell. A thicket of trees and dense brush up to 50 feet wide certainly sprouts up….*  

The enemies get entangled in the vines,, they yell out as their home is getting wrecked by vines and there is serious damage in their infrastructure. Now we hear voices of pain, desperation and fear from the ones.  

We take the creature to the council and they are superstitious about them \- think it's a bad omen to keep them around \- we should set it free, away, in the farms somewhere. Some of them think they should tell the King, others are terrified and creeped out and offer no opinion.   
Matheus has a letter addressed to the Lord of the Winter. He asks them if they know him. They say yes, he is at his castle, ~~North~~ East. 

When the rodent wakes up, he is terrified and feels helpless. We tell him that the crops are dying and that’s why we went there. The creature says that this is because you have taken too much land past what you need and what you justified taking. We are doing what we must to bring balance. We were trying to discourage you from expanding. We are exporters, and we expanded indeed in the forest, so this makes sense to us, it’s justified.

We asked whether they were there way before us.   
Their fathers knew the people that built the magnificent buildings, upon the ruins of what we built \- like the church.   
When the dark moon comes, the vendetta will begin and all you can do is pray. He clearly indicates that they want to ruin our homes. But Matheus realises that there might be something we could do about it. 

When asked how old are you, he spits at you (to Matheus).
