## Prologue

I would say Sigisfarne only has 1 priest - for ~200 people, there wouldn't be more.

If you ask her about Hackett, she says she doesn't know who he is, but that she is not as well read as the higher priestesses of the larger towns. She advises to tread very lightly around him and that he does not sound like a normal person of the earth if he's been down there on his own for who knows how long (and since its unlikely he sneaks down there just to perform a warning to you, and is not a local)

She seems to think it prudent for her to send a missive to the priestess of a larger church to send for a group to cleanse the ruins under the church as they are starting to sound possibly cursed, but since you have been going down there to clear it out, she wants to know if you would like for her to do so or to wait until you've gone deeper. She does worry about your safety though
