**Razzy:** humble, used to be cowardly, she is filthy \- half witch. Forages medicinal herbs and making potions. She’s been on a couple of adventures. 44  
**Yewtree:** Town bonekeeper. He’s buried a lot of people, incl. Clive. Courageous. 12  
**Drake:** Outrider. Escorting caravans or tracking fugitives. Takes job on to use his blade and horse. He might come across as disciplined and aggressive. He has respect for the dead. 29  
**Matheus:** No memory \- beast hunter. 

Collected: 6 rations each 3 uses (berries)  
We ate berries and now we are high. Got rainy and we got real. Get colder and colder.  
1 hour from the cave it is freezing cold.   
20 minutes far: we are going downhill \- there is blood in the grass that’s washing out. You see bodies of animals. One with yellow skin and a bigger animal with dark brown color. Pumas and bisons.  
Matheus kills the almost dead ones.   
4 moving in pain pumas, and 3 bisons already dead. 

**In the cave:**   
After walking a while downwards there is a flooded area.  
Knees deep waters, but it’s quite long.   
There is something in the water \- we hear a splash.  
Matheus threw bait and Cai aimed towards it. A small alligator with red eyes and a tilted mouth, coming slowly towards the lure.   
Another one is coming as well. It looks like they are looking at us.   
Third eye is coming out of the water \- they are not really crooked.   
3-eyes crocodiles that talk in some weird language.

3 doors with wood and iron-bounding. \- petrified wood as well. They have carvings that remind of the church weeping mother.  
3 trees (2 meters tall \+ bit of a root), laying on the floor. They seem to be made of stone.  
Petrified. The middle was wooden. Something like covered in stone.

Limbs of animals and people decomposing where Matheus went. They were pulled, not severed.   
Hissing sound of wind coming from the top \- after taking the piece of bioluminescence stone. The torches are out.

Behind the doors: 

- Smell of dust and mold  
- Statues 2.5 m tall \- resemble carvings seen before \- their faces have been scraped.  
- Floor is black and white tiles. Make patterns like in other secret places.  
- The statues are not necessarily of the symbology of the church.

Faces scrapped with a tool. Some holding staff or other objects.   
Place is super dusty \- closed off for a long time. These statues though, feel like they are looking at me. We feel tired.

Down the stairs there are debris on the left, but not on the right. Pieces of stone.   
Massive triangular recessed on the floor. 

Statue hanging on the ceiling \- different from the other statues. Clothes are caricaturish of normal clothes \- face is also a caricature \- fat, double chinned, fat arms and belly. Serpents coiled around it \- held by chains.

Cai says “ we don’t need to find all the answers, just the right ones, let’s move ahead. “ and tries to open the next door.   
Mateus steps on the triangle and the floor falls, thankfully while hanging from the statue.   
Cai gets startled and breaks her knife.  
The floor below has the same patterns as the one above it. Furniture that resembles the ruined church desks, long benches. 

Room below: pieces of statues \- looks like a cathedral \- walls have cracks with tall mushrooms coming out of them \- about 1 meter tall. Bag on the floor with a music box in it \- ballerinas. Statue inside.
