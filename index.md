# **unsettled**

![](https://i.imgur.com/jrDqZJV.png)

People settle in villages and towns.
They bring order to their lives and surroundings.
Strict hierarchy and rules apply.
This pleases ***Law***.

Dark places spread and fold and coil unto themselves.
Like an ever growing virus.
They make the impermanent.
This pleases ***Chaos***.

***Law*** and ***Chaos*** hate each other destructively.
They can only act on their hate through their acolytes.

You led a normal life.
Not anymore.
You are now ***unsettled***.
