**unsettled**
{: .text-alpha }

![](https://i.imgur.com/jrDqZJV.png)

People settle in villages and towns.  
They bring order to their lives and surroundings.  
Strict hierarchy and rules apply.  
This pleases ***Law***.

Dark places spread and fold and coil unto themselves.  
Like an ever-growing virus.  
They make the impermanent.  
This pleases ***Chaos***.

***Law*** and ***Chaos*** hate each other destructively.  
They can only act on their hate through their acolytes.

You led a normal life.  
Not anymore.  
You are now ***unsettled***.
