Located in the base of a mountain.
Ruined bath system.
Entrance to the Blue Mountain realm through Iron Doors.
Cannot be open from the outside.
A silver skull keeps it open.

Hideout of petty bandits that steal rural villages.
Their treasures are kept safe by Chaos Cultists

Two villagers went in a few days ago.
They killed one bandit and one Murk.
