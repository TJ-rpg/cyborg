The doors are heavy.
Inside are larger-than-life statues of people in noble but strange clothes.
Their faces have been scrapped.
The doric columns smell like dust, and the ceiling is very high and fan-vaulted.

Down the stairs, there is a large floor trap.
Above, a massive statue of a very fat person, repugnant and weird.
