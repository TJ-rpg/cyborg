- Clings to the edge of the old forest.
- Founding forgotten by living memory, ancient farmland.
- A hundred crooked buildings lean against each other, their timbers groaning with age. The paths between them sink deep.
- Built on, around and in the ruins of a past civilisation, with ancient architectural modes different from what we use in the village now. These structures were put together by talented artifices.
- There is a crown of the kingdom to whom we pay taxes based on farm exports to the south, through the river.

#### Truths

- Multiple crop failures in the recent past

## Ruined Church

- Central freestanding ruin looks like an ancient church. It has never been claimed by the village, and sits mostly abandoned, with its iron gate barred.
- A structure older than memory, they say, its stones laid before our ancestors claimed this land as home.
- The place has been closed for many generations, despite being in the middle of the village. Many say it is older than the village, which is already ancient.
- Broken stone floor, an altar with symbols of our own religion, the [Church of the Weeping Mother](../weepingMother/index.md).
- Decrepit furniture with runic scratching, and a scaffolding in one of the sides of the building.
- Bell tower, bell lays in the floor, where raptors made a nest. Staircases up are very worn.

### Tombs

- Downstairs there are 4 tunnels: bread, crown, teardrop and halo. Smell of decay and moist. 
- Tunnel of the **Crown**: five stone coffins, four violated, with sculpture of kings, in weird ornaments. One of them holds a regalia that looks from the Church of the Weeping Mother.  
- Tunnel of the **Halo**: freestanding coffins, open. Figures look religious, from the Church of the Weeping Mother.
