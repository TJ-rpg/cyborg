You delve deep into the Wood, prying its secrets from between rough boughs and whispering leaves. To this verdant kingdom, you are not a mere scholar but its confidant.  

You have a towering physique, rosy skin and filthy hair. Your face is Rakish, your speech Blunt. You have foreign clothing. You are disciplined and vengeful. You are 29 years old.

**Bond:** A white crow appeared to you in a dream, holding a twig in its mouth. You awoke the next morning with The Twig (petty) in your hand. You believe it brings you luck. It smells faintly of sulphur.
